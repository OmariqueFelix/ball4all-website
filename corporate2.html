          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-3 mb-3">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
		  <h6> Our Brand </h6>
          <p>At Ball4all, we are on a mission to help users create an easily accessible community amongst amateur football players. In doing research, we discovered that football is an extremely common and popular team sport in The Netherlands, therefore we decided to focus on football to obtain maximum engagement and strengthen a community that is already visible in The Netherlands. In a world where people often have incredibly busy schedules, we aim to provide an accommodating and flexible platform that allows users to still participate in their passion. Our campaign is not only about promoting a product, it is about allowing people to celebrate the joy of football. </p>
          <h6> What is the Campaign About? </h6>
          <p>The Ball4All campaign revolves around distributing content that builds excitement while introducing our brand features. Through our posts we aim to build a community in the football world, demonstrating how we plan to make their life easier while gaining their trust by incorporating real people’ opinions through street interviews. Through our campaign we aim to spark meaningful conversations and represent the individuals who make up the community of The Netherlands football scene. </p>
		  <h6>The Message</h6>
          <p>The tagline for our campaign is “FWB. Football with Benefits. All the Benefits without Commitment”. Through the tagline our brand aims to demonstrate a company that provides features to help make a footballers experience and life easier, allowing them to access benefits of the sport without having to commit to a club. Our message is consistently represented throughout our content and social media platforms, including the tagline in videos and our bio, as well as having posts that further explain how we plan to execute our vision.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4 mb-3">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>Identify and justify your learning point (based on the Communication & Media Plan). What did you learn during the duration of the project concerning the campaign? What worked and what didn’t? What went as expected and what didn’t? What would you do differently? Reflect on the past work and describe what you learned.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 mb-3">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>Reflection on what has been done and describe in detail what you would do if the project would continue.</p>
          <p>Describe in detail your future recommendations if the campaign would be continued.</p>
          <p>Detail and describe clearly the process of what your would do differently based on you experience on this project related to the marketing assignment.</p>
          <p>In reflecting on our marketing journey, it is evident that our campaign has undergone significant growth as overtime we began to utilize more features on the platform to promote our content. However, it is evident that we did not reach our goal of 3000 impressions. If the project were to continue, we would be able to use the experience we have gained in the month of content creation, to implement a strategy aimed at further enhancing engagement and solidifying our brand identity. The following recommendation represents a detailed outline of how we would strive for future success.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Transition to a Business Account: The first recommendation and change our team would implement is making our social media accounts a business profile from the beginning. Transforming our platforms into business accounts would allow us to have access to in-depth analytics, representing the growth our company has shown overtime and from the beginning. In having this tool we would be able to review engagement insights and reflect on what we can do each post to improve, such as posting at a different time/day, using different hashtags and discovering the type of content that our audience enjoys most.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Strategic Hashtags: In using hashtags, we believe it has helped our brand to get engagement, therefore in the future of our campaign we would continue to utilize relevant and trending hashtags across both social media platforms. However, a change we would implement is doing further research on what hashtags are trending and incorporating a lot more hashtags than 4-5, in order to enhance the chance of viewers to discover our company.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Establishing a Consistent Tone of Voice: In reflecting, we discovered that it is crucial to establish a consistent tone of voice that resonates with our target audience from the beginning. Initially our team wanted to represent a more serious and cinematic approach to our content. However, after doing research, we quickly realized the type of content our target audience typically views which is more laid back. In addition, we realized the importance of our tone which was incorporating slang versus professional text, which resonates more with our audience. Therefore, in creating a distinct brand voice, it allows us to connect more with our audience and establish a stronger brand identity.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Posting More: In reflecting on the journey of our campaign, it is evident that we should have begun posting content sooner and more frequently. On platforms such as TikTok, posting everyday allows a greater chance to reach viewers and appear on users' pages. In addition, posting more frequently allows viewers to engage with content and develop a stronger understanding and relationship of the brand.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Overall, we believe in future planning, by following these future recommendations, discovered through research and content analytics, we believe we can redirect our campaign to increase visibility and growth. &nbsp;</p>
