    </div>
	 <div class="row poppins-regular">
 <p class="bodytext"> At Ball4all, we are on a mission to help users create an easily accessible community amongst amateur football players. In doing research, we discovered that football is an extremely common and popular team sport in The Netherlands, therefore we decided to focus on football to obtain maximum engagement and strengthen a community that is already visible in The Netherlands. In a world where people often have incredibly busy schedules, we aim to provide an accommodating and flexible platform that allows users to still participate in their passion. Our campaign is not only about promoting a product, it is about allowing people to celebrate the joy of football. 
 </p>
	</div>
		
	 <div class="row poppins-semibold subtitle mb-2"> What is the Campaign About?
    </div>
	 <div class="row poppins-regular">
 <p class="bodytext"> The Ball4All campaign revolves around distributing content that builds excitement while introducing our brand features. Through our posts we aim to build a community in the football world, demonstrating how we plan to make their life easier while gaining their trust by incorporating real people’ opinions through street interviews. Through our campaign we aim to spark meaningful conversations and represent the individuals who make up the community of The Netherlands football scene. 
 </p>
	</div>
	
		<div class="row poppins-semibold subtitle mb-2"> The Message
    </div>
	 <div class="row poppins-regular">
 <p class="bodytext"> The tagline for our campaign is “FWB. Football with Benefits. All the Benefits without Commitment”. Through the tagline our brand aims to demonstrate a company that provides features to help make a footballers experience and life easier, allowing them to access benefits of the sport without having to commit to a club. Our message is consistently represented throughout our content and social media platforms, including the tagline in videos and our bio, as well as having posts that further explain how we plan to execute our vision. 
 </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="row poppins-semibold subtitle mb-2"> Promotional Activities Executed
    </div>
	 <div class="row poppins-regular">
 <p class="bodytext"> To bring our message to life and connect with our audience, we've executed a variety of promotional activities: </p>
 <p class="bodytext"> 1. Instagram and TikTok Content: We've launched engaging campaigns on Instagram and TikTok to showcase our brand and its features. Through street interviews, brand feature descriptions, brand collaborations and company introduction posts, we have worked towards inviting our viewers to become part of the growing community. </p>
 <p class="bodytext"> 2. Brand Collaborations: We have reached out to other brands to collaborate and share each other's content. Through this process we attempted to gain brand connections while continuously promoting and growing our brand. </p>
 <p class="bodytext"> 3. Interactive Components and Trends: We've launched interactive components on our stories in an attempt to once again make viewers feel they are connected with the brand and have a voice. In addition, we have posted videos following trends such as street interviews as well as using trending audios in our video to gain traction.</p> 
 <p class="bodytext"> 4. Hashtags: In each of our posts we ensured to include at least 3-4 hashtags in the caption. These often consisted of tags that correlated with our post, as well as tags that are popular in the football community. 
 </p>
	</div>

<div class="row poppins-semibold subtitle mb-2"> The Objective - SMART
    </div>
	 <div class="row poppins-regular">
 <p class="bodytext"> (Specific) We want to grow brand awareness by creating different types of content on both Instagram and Tik Tok. Our content will feature street interviews where we go around the hotspots of Breda, interacting directly with our target audience. Moreover, in these interviews, we ask questions about their difficulties as an amateur football player, whilst also asking about the usability of our features. Therefore, by posting these kinds of videos, we predict that most of our target audience have faced the same problems, creating a sense of belonging. In addressing the difficulties of amateur football players and seeking feedback on our brand features, it will allow our team to create a relatable brand, while genuinely addressing our target audience's needs. Creating a foundation of trust when building a long-lasting community. 
 </p>
 <p class="bodytext"> (Measurable) Our goal would be to reach 3000 impressions on both platforms. Population of Breda (since we’re going to interact with it the most) 180.000. 6% of the Netherland’s population play football, extrapolating and applying it to the population of Breda, we have 10.800. 50% are males and given the fact our target audience is based on male amateur football players between the ages of 18-24, 3000 impressions is predicted to be an achievable goal. 
 </p>	
 <p class="bodytext"> (Achievable) By reaching our goal, we will attract more customers towards the website/app, building a long-lasting community in time. 
 </p>
 <p class="bodytext"> (Timely) We’d like to achieve this goal within a month.
 </p>	 
	</div>
		
	<div class="row poppins-semibold subtitle mb-2"> The Selected Channels/Platforms
    </div>
	 <div class="row poppins-regular">
 <p class="bodytext"> We chose Instagram and TikTok as our channels due to the fact that they are the most relevant social media platforms for our target audience, male amateur football players aged 18-23. We got to this conclusion based on interviews with our target audience, all of them mentioning both. However, most of them use TikTok for entertainment and Instagram for both news and entertainment. Therefore, we chose to use Instagram for more “serious” posts such as our feature showcase, and TikTok for more funny, light-hearted content such as “types of footballers”.
	   </p>
 <p class="bodytext"> In addition, Instagram and TikTok are both known for their engaging formats, providing an ideal platform for sharing content and gaining viewers. The platforms are powerful tools in building brand visibility and reaching a large audience, providing our brand the opportunity to introduce our company to a variety of potential customers. Through the various features that platforms provide, such as stories, reels, reposts and short TikTok our team is provided flexibility to share our content in various forms. Including call-to-action in our posts and utilizing engagement features on our stories, it encourages a relationship with our audience. The platforms allow our team to experiment and discover which format captures our audience's attention most.
	   </p>
 <p class="bodytext"> Therefore, we utilized the platform's key benefits by incorporating trending audios, hashtags and many additional engagement tactics, in an attempt to reach our goal of 3000 impressions. The platforms provide a sense of community as it often caters to viewers interests, allowing football players in the Netherlands to discover our curated content for the sport.
